# Student Performance Predictor (Maths Score) - End-to-End ML Project

Welcome to the Student Performance Predictor, a machine learning model designed to predict Maths scores based on various factors. This project is deployed at   [http://gauravkumarchaurasiya.pythonanywhere.com/](http://gauravkumarchaurasiya.pythonanywhere.com/).  

## Overview

This web application aims to predict a student's Maths score by considering several factors, such as Gender, Race or Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, Test Preparation Course, Writing Score, and Reading Score.

The model will generate a prediction for your Maths score based on the input parameters.

## Important Note

- This prediction is based on a machine learning model and should be considered as an estimate.
- The model's accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training data.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
